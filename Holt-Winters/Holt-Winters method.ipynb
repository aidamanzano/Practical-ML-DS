    "\n",
    "A time series is a sample of measurements of some interesting quantity taken repeatedly over a sustained period of time. It is mathematically represented as a set of vectors x(t),t = 0,1,2,... where t represents the time elapse and the variable x(t) is treated as a random variable. A defining characteristic of a time series is that it is a list of observations where the ordering matters so the data is not necessarily independent and identically distributed. Changing the order of the datapoints could change the meaning of the data. \n",

    "## Forecasting\n",
    "The rest of this notebook will be focusing on time series forecasting and building up to how to use the Holt-Winters method for time series forecasting in particular. But first what is the difference between the terms time series analysis and time series forecasting? Time series analysis is a form of descriptive modeling, this means that someone conducting time series analysis will be looking at a dataset to identify trends and seasonal patterns in the hostorical data, fitting mathematical models to capture the underlying nature of the process generating the data etc. Time series forecasting is a form of predictive modelling with the goal to predict a future value at a particular point in time based on the values we do know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notation and terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a time series the values we do know are referred to as observed values and the values we are trying to forecast are referred to as expected values. In general, we use the notation $\\hat{y}$ to denote expected values. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a series that looks like [2,4,6,8,10], we might forecast the next value of this series to be 12. Using this terminology and notation, the observed values are $y_1=2$, $y_2=4$, $y_3=6$, $y_4=8$, $y_5=10$ i.e the observed series is [2,4,6,8,10] and the next expected value is $\\hat{y_6}=12$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to have some metrics to evaluate the accuracy of our forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error is the difference between an observed value and its forecast. Given a training dataset {$y_{1},\\dots, y_{T}$} and a test dataset {$y_{T+1}, y_{T+2},\\dots$}, the error of a forecast at a given time interval T+h is denoted as $e_{T+h}=y_{T+h} - \\hat{y_{T+h}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the error can be positive or negative it is more helpful to use the absolute terms or as common convention square the error the value is always positive. The sum of squared errors (SSE) is given by $SSE = {\\Sigma_{i=1}}^{i=n} ( y_{i} - \\hat{y_{i}})^{2}$. The SSE measures the inexplained variability or discrepancy between the observed data and the forecasted data. Another common metric used is the mean squared error which is given by $MSE=\\frac{1}{n}{\\Sigma_{i=1}}^{i=n} ( y_{i} - \\hat{y_{i}})^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note to self: explain where n comes from or change the notion in error definition to include n."

    "## Some simple forecasting methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest forecasting method. For naive forecasts we set all forecasts to be the same value as the last observed value. That is \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}_{T+1}=y_{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a time series that looks like [14,20,18,17,24], then using the naive method the forecast for the next point would be 24. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is simply the expected value of the next datapoint is the arithmetic mean of all of the previous datapoints. That is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}_{T+1}=\\frac{1}{T}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=T} y_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a time series that looks like [19.2,17.8,15.1,14.3,15.0,16.7,15.2], then using the average method the forecast for the next point would be 16.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moving Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "An improvement over the taking average of all points is instead only taking the average of the n latest datapoints. In this method only the most recent values matter. In practise this forecasting method can be effective if the right choice of n is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}_{T+1}=\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=0}^{i=n-1} y_{T-i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Moving Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "A weighted moving average is a moving average but within the window of n points each point is assigned a different weighting. Typically the most recent points are assigned a higher weight as these would be more relevant to the forecast being made. Note that the weights assigned must add to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}_{T+1}=\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n} w_{i} . y_{T+1-i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_{1}, w_{2}, \\cdots, w_{n}$ are weights to be assigned.\n",
